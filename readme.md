# Fractals by Waschi
This is a little application just to have fun with working and trying crazy stuff with fractals. It's not much and I think there is much space to improve but here are the prototypes of this application.
I hope you have fun doing crazy stuff with this and maybe add in other fractals. 
### Adding stuff
Feel free to do whatever you want with this code. I will add an guide later what is the easiest way to do so.  
### Note
Most to code regarding the javafx stuff is copied from one of my other projects
